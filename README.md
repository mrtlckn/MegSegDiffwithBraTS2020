# MegSegDiffwithBraTS2020
Project for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course


1 - MedSegDiff: Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Model

- You can access the main paper [[click](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00611)] here. I would like to thank the authors of this paper and those who published the code.
- Furthermore you can click on the project codes to go to Google Colab and run them. However, for the MedSegDiff project to function, you will need a Google Colab Pro account and an A100 GPU.

2 - U-Net

- You can click on the project codes to go to Google Colab and run them without needing a Pro account.
